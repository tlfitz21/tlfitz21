- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tanner FitzGerald, @tlfitz21.
-  Iâ€™m interested in learning as much as I can about computer science, especially software development.
-  Iâ€™m currently learning the fundamentals of computer science like object oriented programming, data structures,
      algorithm analysis, computer organization, discrete structures, computer systems, and various languages including Python, Java, and C++/C#.
- I have a portfolio here containing all the programs I've written to learn coding since starting my AS in Computer Science!
- I'm looking for a job to kickstart my career anywhere in the broad field of comuter science, with a slight focus in software development.
- You can reach me for career topics with my email, tlfitz21@gmail.com, or on my linkedIn, www.linkedin.com/in/tanner-fitzgerald21.

- Fun fact: I have been working in kitchens for almost a decade, so I have a handful of life and work skills to bring with me on this new career path!
